      <h1>Then vs Now</h1>
      <article>Let us take a little trip down Falon's Memory Lane and soon we will end up on Falon's Avenues of Growth. 
         Let's jump right into my relationship with fear and how it has changed over the years. Notice that I said the relationship with fear changed, I didn't say that the 
         relationship was eradicated. I view fear in the same vein as germs. There are healthy germs and bad germs. No need to get rid of germs altogether, oftentimes bad germs help
         to build our tolerance level for bad germs. I see fear the same way. There is a healthy fear that can propel you into your destiny and a paralyzing fear that can kill every
         dream you have been given. I didn't want to eradicate fear from my life, but rather change my relationship to fear. 
         I used to let fear stop me from doing any and everything. 
         When faced with something that scared or intimidated me, I would freeze right in my tracks! The thought of something bad happening to me or my children from a 
         decision that I made, terrified me. It was so bad that there were times when my own shadow scared me! How crazy is that?! It's the truth, though. Hey, if you agree, this is 
         no judgment zone - it's safe in here. </article>

      <p>Four years ago, my sisters and I took a much needed vacation to Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. 
         We laid out on the beach (even though I hate sand), ate at the best restaurants (even though I don't like to eat outside), laughed hysterically (oftentimes at my expense), 
         and most of all - we had fun and relaxed! One day at breakfast, both of my sisters started laughing, but I did not understand why. 
         When I asked them what was so funny, they both said, slowly: "Don't look, but there is a lizard behind you!" 
         I immediately freeze! I know I can't scream because that's not appropriate in this setting, but I am terrified, as you can see in this picture.</p> 

         
         <image src = "images/FalonIsAfraid.jpeg" alt = "Falon too scared to turn around because there is a Lizard behind her."></image>

         <main>My sisters sisters kept saying, "Oh calm down! You're fine! The lizard isn't even thinking about you!" 
            I was certainly thinking about the lizard! All kinds of questions filled my mind, "Was it close to me?" "Could it smell my fear?" "Was it going to harm me?" I couldn't even 
            look, I was so terrified! While I am thinking, my sisters are cracking up! Until one sister asked, "Wait a minute? Where does this fear stem from? Why are you so scared of a 
            tiny lizard? This has to be deeper, it cannot be this lizard!" I ate in silence that morning because I didn't know the answers to the questions she was asking. I had to go internal
            and ask myself, why was I so scared? Clearly, the lizard thought nothing about me, but I was so scared I couldn't concentrate until I knew it was gone. These unanswered questions 
            caused me to search myself, sit with myself, be honest with myself, and most important be gentle with myself. 

   
         <p>It is true, small things, medium-sized things, and large things all scared me. But why? It all boiled down to fear. Fear of the unknown, fear of what I couldn't control, fear of what 
            I would find, fear of not doing well, fear of failure, fear of embarassment if something didn't work out as expected, fear of what others would say, fear of what would happen 
            to my family, and the list goes on and on. I didn't waste too much time in the minutia of fear, but rather in how it related to me. What was my relationship with fear? Since fear and I 
            had become quite the couple, I wanted to know why fear became my bedside friend. Why did I let fear stop me? Why did I allow fear to control me? Why did I let fear do the choosing
            for my life?</p>

            
         <p>At the opening of 2020, I set out to conquer everything that scared me. The events on the list that scared me were: 1) Leaving my current position at work; 2) Beginning the process for 
            purchasing a home; 3) Applying for Grows to Code. Even though I expected that these things would happen in 2020, they didn't. I disciplined myself, cut back on spending and revved up on 
            saving, paid off my debts, and began the process in February of 2022. My boyfriend, (at the time) Fear, had me believing that none of these would be possible to accomplish because of all 
            of my deficits. I told Fear to stand there while I called his bluff! In February of 2022, I applied for a mortgage and was denied twice, in May of 2022 I applied to Grows to Code, even 
            though I didn't think there was a chance I would be picked, and I did it all while Fear watched! I was accepted into the Grows to Code Program in June of 2022 and in July 2022, my three
            children and I closed on our brand new condo! I am grateful to the Lord for holding me together during the process to getting where I am today. I also thank Fear for sitting and having a
            front row seat to my growth! You see, fear will always be there, it's all in how you and I relate to it. Do we continue to believe the lies that fear tells us? Or do we stand in the face of
            fear and accomplish our goals and dreams and place fear under our feet? The choice is ours! </p>
